## <b>Abandonment:</b>

<p>If a Program Member is absent without approval from Camp Mercy overnight or for more than one day, they will be considered to have resigned from the Program and any personal property along with the Tiny House will be surrendered to the Camp Coordinator. An attempt will be made with the resident then emergency contact. If that is not satisfied any items left will then be donated or disposed of.</p>
