## FINANCIAL STABILITY PLAN:

<p>While you are at Camp Mercy your case manager will assist you through becoming proficient in your own financial management. You will be learning ways to manage your income and expenses. We will be setting future financial goals to attempt to clear up any outstanding debt you may have.</p> 

<p>The Camp Coordinator will oversee this process to maintain the integrity of the residents budgeting and saving for your future secure living situation.
This <b>"Financial Stability Plan"</b> must be followed in order to be a Camp Mercy Resident. <b>Failure to follow this process will make you ineligible to remain in Camp Mercy.</b></p>

<p>You will identity any items in collections that need to be taken care of. Those who are financially capable of handling their finances will just be on a weekly update and monthly audit and less instruction will be needed.</p>

<p>Because of the precious time allowed for mastering your finances, any unauthorized spending will be in violation and can result in dismissal from the program.
Residents will be asked to separate and add up their spending at the end of each week into 4 separate categories:</p>

1) Bills paid (No new debt without prior approval)
2) Unexpected Expense (Needs prior approval)
3) Food Budget (Amount agreed on between resident and Case Manager to follow)
4) Entertainment Spending (Can NOT exceed 10% of your paycheck)

<p>The rest of your income is to be saved in a checking or savings account of your choice for your nest egg and to become financially self dependent.</p>  

<p>Residents are required to submit a weekly bank statement showing their spending compliance. Because the nature of our sobriety program, any cash withdrawals will need to be explained in detail with receipts. It is more efficient for you and the case manager if you don't withdraw money but use your debt card. Learning to manage income and expenses as well as save for the future is an invaluable life skill.</p>
