## INTAKE / PROGRAM DURATION:

<p>Subject to successfully completing the application process and background check, Program Members will be admitted to Camp Mercy for an initial period of up to 30 days. At the end of the first week, Program Members will meet with Camp Coordinator to determine short term goals to address any immediate needs like medical, dental, acquiring any documents needed and future housing goals.</p> 

<p>Thereafter, Program Members will meet with the Camp Mercy Coordinator each week to discuss progress towards established goals and to set new goals. Goals will include becoming proficient in financial management, including budgeting. Camp Mercy is intended to help Program Members determine what specific changes need to be made in their lives, including financial management, to become self-sufficient.</p> 

<p>At the end of each 30 day cycle, Program Members will be evaluated to determine if the agreed upon goals are being met, and if not why. Extension to the expiring 30 days stay as a Program Member will be determined at that time based on adherence to Camp rules and progress towards agreed goals. The Mission will renew the 30 day cycle up to six (6) times for Program Members who are making a good faith effort to become employed and self-sufficient members of society. <b>This will be determined case by case.</b></p> 

<p>The Missions intent is to come beside Program Members and give them a hand up not just a handout. If at any time the Executive Director or Camp Mercy Coordinator determines that a Program Member is not serious about life change in a clean and sober environment the Program Member may be discharged from the Camp.</p> 

<p><b>All Program Members must abide by the rules below.</b></p>

<p>Violations of these rules will result in disciplinary action and may be grounds for immediate discharge from the Program and being asked to immediately leave Mission property. It is the Program Members responsibility to remain familiar with all program rules and standards.</p>
